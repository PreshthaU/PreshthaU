## 👋 Hi, I'm Preshtha!

I'm an aspiring data analyst who’s driven by a deep curiosity and the thrill of solving puzzles. Whether it's breaking down a messy dataset or figuring out how broken objects fit back together, I love understanding how things work, and more importantly, _why_ they work that way.

My background isn’t traditional for a role in data, but I’ve spent the past year learning everything I can: through coursework, hands-on projects, and a lot of late nights spent staring at spreadsheets and Python scripts. Despite the ups and downs, I’m still here, still excited, and doing everything I can to turn this into a career I love.

P.S. This portfolio is a work in progress, but unlike some of my crochet projects, it's going to turn out great. 

### 🔎 What I'm Good At
  * **Tools & Languages**: Excel, SQL, Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas), Tableau, some experience with Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and CNNs
  * **Soft Skills**: Leadership, communication, teamwork, and presentations
  * **Learning Mindset**: I love asking questions, and I'm comfortable navigating ambiguity—both of which are invaluable when you're self-taught

### 📁 Projects
 * 🗒️ **[User Engagement Analysis (Excel)](https://github.com/PreshthaU/Customer_Engagement_Analysis-Excel)**: Using sample data from 365 Data Science
 * ⭐ **[Spartifical Galaxy Zoo Challenge](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DdjjQql0ZLlWiWsb4NLnGBlJ35YirZiZ?usp=sharing)**: Built neural networks to classify objects using tabular SDSS data
 * 👻 _Coming Soon_: Horror Trends Analysis (a passion project of mine)

### 📚 Currently Learning
  * More advanced SQL and Tableau
  * Fundamentals of R
  * Making problem-solving more intuitive through practice and project-based learning

### 🎯 Looking For
I'm seeking junior data analyst internships or roles where I can support teams through:  

    - Preprocessing and cleaning datasets  
    - Conducting analysis in Excel or SQL  
    - Turning messy data into clear, actionable insights  
    - Presenting findings in a way that helps people make better decisions
